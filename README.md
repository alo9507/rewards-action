# Octobay Rewards Action

A GitHub Action to automate crypto payments to your contributors.

Currently only issue rewards (e.g. bug bounties) are possible but other feature will follow.

## Inputs

### `rewards`

**Required** The configuration for what to pay when.

Example:

```yaml
rewards:
  - labels: ['bug']
    rewards: ['0.01 ETH']
```

### `seed-phrase`

**Required** The seed phrase for the wallet that pays contributors.

### `label-authority`

Only this user can trigger reward payouts by labeling issues. Default `any user with permission to label issues`.

### `rpc-node`

An ethereum RPC node. Default `"https://mainnet.rpc.fiews.io/v1/free"`.

## Outputs

### `tx`

The Ethereum transaction receipt.

## Example usage

You need to set a wallet seed phrase as a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

```yaml
